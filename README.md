# MD5hashcracker
This Python script aims to crack commonly used passwords by generating all possible strings of length 1 to 6 and hashing them using the MD5 algorithm. The list of cracked passwords is printed to the console at the end of the script.

    Open a terminal window on Kali Linux.
    Navigate to the directory where the Python script is located using the "cd" command.
    Type the command python3 filename.py where filename.py is the name of your Python script file. 
    For example, if your Python script is saved as script333.py, you would type python3 script333.py into the terminal window.
    Press Enter to run the script.

The script should now execute and any output generated by the script will be displayed in the terminal window.
In this case, the script will print a list of cracked passwords to the console.
